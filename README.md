      My purpose

    <p align = center>
      I'm <br>
      Just <br>
      Hanging <br>
      Out <br>
      With <br>
      Some <br>
      Non-sense <br>
      Projects <br>
      For <br>
      Practicing <br>
      Simple <br>
      Codes.<br>

    <h2>
        My REAL purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
        I'm open to new knowledge so I take learning codes as and a puzzle and hobby <br>
        for me to challenge myself besides my main career. I mean, soon enough humans <br>
        should at least know how to communicate with computers in the future, shouldn't they?<br><br>
        Don't judge me, I truly admire those who are from IT.<br>

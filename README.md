      I'm <br>
      Just <br>
      Hanging <br>

      Some <br>
      Non-sense <br>
      Projects <br>
      For <br>
      Practicing <br>

        My REAL purpose

    <p style="margin-left: 100; padding: 10">
        I'm open to new knowledge so I take learning codes as and a puzzle and hobby <br>
        for me to challenge myself besides my main career. I mean, soon enough humans <br>
        should at least know how to communicate with computers in the future, shouldn't they?<br><br>
        By the way, I like designing so I am toward to website design.<br>
        Don't judge me, I truly admire those who are from IT.<br>
